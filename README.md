# NOHS-Edge-Client
It is just an app that directs you to the North Oldham High School Edge class signup form with an inputted username and password (since the official app just doesn't work).

# Planned features
- Native list of Edge classes and native signup (would require me to code a custom HTML scraper etc)
- Notifications 5 minutes before your Edge class starts reminding you what class you signed up for
- Auto-renewal for Edge classes (given that the class is present every week, like study hall or something)
- Pretty much anything you want, make requests to corvettecole@gmail.com with subject title "NOHS Edge Feature Request".
