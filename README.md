# ARCHIVED
This project has been unpublished from the Play Store and further development ceased due to me not attending the school any longer and being unable to support it. I will leave the code here just for archival purposes. This was the first app I ever made.


# NOHS-Edge-Client
This is an alternative to the NOHS Stampede official app.
Compared to the official Stampede app, this app is:
- Smaller (roughly 10x smaller app size)
- More modern (app targets Android O and supports advanced battery optimizations)
- Actively developed
- Smarter (Daily classes are displayed front and center)
- Faster (Important data is saved, allowing the app to not need to reload everything on every launch)

# Planned features
- Auto-renewal for Edge classes (given that the class is present every week, like study hall or something)
- Pretty much anything you want, make requests to corvettecole@gmail.com with subject title "NOHS Edge Feature Request".
