# NOHS-Edge-Client
This is an alternative to the NOHS Stampede official app.
Compared to the official Stampede app, this app is:
- Smaller(roughly 10x smaller app size)
- More modern (app targets Android O and supports advanced battery optimizations
- Actively developed (I don't have a life)
- Faster (advanced caching and loading methods)

# Planned features
- Native list of Edge classes and native signup (would require me to code a custom HTML scraper etc)
- Notifications 5 minutes before your Edge class starts reminding you what class you signed up for
- Auto-renewal for Edge classes (given that the class is present every week, like study hall or something)
- Pretty much anything you want, make requests to corvettecole@gmail.com with subject title "NOHS Edge Feature Request".
